/ started with divs under one common container div and the sub divs were named marker and 
later on named uniquely adding one two three respectively and they were styles with different 
bg colors which are rgb and with a margin 10px by auto to separate them
we used the parent name marker to style the height and width by 25 by 200px respectively for dimensions
later on added a padding to the container to add spaces at both the top and bottom 
started styling the child markers using the rgb functions to make secondary colours which are 
magenta cyan  and yellow and later on took a break but to start off with tertiary colors
cyan is made by adding green to blue 
magenta is made by adding red to blue 
yellow is made by adding red to it
